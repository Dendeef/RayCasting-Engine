# RayCasting-Engine

I made this project to learn and practice simple rendering methods.

# How to use

You can use the raycasting engine with the following link:

If you start the application you can use your mouse and the UP/DOWN Arrow keys to move around.

If you stay stuck inside the screen press ESC.

# Changing the map

If you would like to change the map you should download the code and go to: INDEX.JS

If you open up the file you immediately the following code:

```
const map = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  ];
```

Every 1 is a "block" so you can change the 0 to 1 or the other way around. After some playing you can get something like this:

```
const map =[
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
];
```
