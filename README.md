# Changing the map

If you would like to change the map you should download the code and go to: INDEX.JS

If you open up the file you immediately the following code:

```
const map = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
